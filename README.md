# Oh, hi Mark <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

Bilingual (English & Bahasa Indonesia), diligent, and competitive person, I am overly committed to finishing my tasks and striving to be better than others. When I am interested in a topic, I immerse myself in that topic to the point where I know I am confident that I can teach others on the subject.

## ðŸ“· Photography
When I'm not in front of my laptop, I'll be behind the camera! I like to show them off on my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/paynedeath) as well as on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/paynejames) and because I love open source, on [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/@james-adhitthana-233943) too.
